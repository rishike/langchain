Each team played twice against the teams in their group and the team in the same row in the other group, and once against the remaining four teams in the other group. After the group stage, the top four teams based on aggregate points qualified for the playoffs. In this stage, the top two teams competed with each other (in a match titled \"Qualifier 1\"), as did the remaining two teams (in a match titled \"Eliminator\").
